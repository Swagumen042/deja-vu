# deja-vu
Some practice problems.


# Some of the problems shown:

  Given four integers, a,b,c,d, display the following fractions: a/b, c/d, (a/b)+(c/d), (a/b)+(c/d) in simplified form, (a/b)\*(c/d), and (a/b)\*(c/d) in simplified form. Use a function to help you find the gcd (greatest common divisor) of two numbers.
  
  Calculate permutations of n taken as k, with the help of a function.
 
  Calculate combinations of n taken as k, with the help of a factorial function.
  
  Check if a number is prime via Wilson's Theorem (which says that a number is prime if and only if it is divisible with ((p-1)!+1)
Use a factorial function to help you with the criteria. <i>Mulțumesc Chiș</i>
  
  Write a function to calculate x^n for x and n - integers.
  
  <b>\*\*Write code that will rotate an NxN array to the right by 90 degrees by using only one auxiliary variable.
  Do the same to the left.</b> The implementation of this includes functions that deal with reading and saving files.
  So basically, don't worry about it.
  
  More will be added as I get tired of life. (But you can do the same by submitting a pull request and by modifying this README yourself.)
